# Sample Blog Draft

This is a sample draft file. Write your analysis, research notes, or rough ideas here.
The AI blog generator will transform this into a polished blog post.

## How to Write a Draft

1. Create a new `.md` or `.txt` file in this `blog_drafts/` folder
2. Write your thoughts, analysis, data, findings, or rough notes
3. Include images by placing them in this folder alongside your markdown file
4. Add YouTube video links on their own line to embed them
5. Git commit and push — the GitHub Action will do the rest!

## Draft Format Tips

### Use Headings for Structure
Organize your draft with headings. The AI will use these as guidance.

### Include Data Points
```
- Metric A: 45% improvement
- Metric B: 2x faster than baseline
- Number of users: 10,000+
```

### Add Your Opinion / Analysis
Write what you think the data means. The AI will expand on your analysis.

### Reference Images
Place image files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`) in this same folder.
Reference them in your draft:
```markdown
![Chart showing growth](./my-chart.png)
```

### Embed Videos
Just paste a YouTube URL on its own line:
```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
```

## Metadata (Optional)

You can add frontmatter to guide the AI:
```yaml
---
title: "Suggested Title"
tags: ["AI", "Data Science"]
---
```

If you don't add metadata, the AI will generate appropriate title and tags.
