## My Notes

Cricket worldcup t20 group stage is at near end, by this time blog was posted almost 7 teams already confirmed and only one position left for super 8 stage.

## Teams:
Suprisingly Australia eliminated from group stage whcih no one exepcted and everyone though that one or two associated nations will enter into super 8, with incredible perfromance from Zimbambe and win on Aus almost confimed their super 8 spot, where rain helped them for confirmation and bad luck to Australia, hope they will bounce back in next series.

Italy's first win in world cup was special and Nepal got some close matches, especial lost match against England at the last ball, it was fighted till last. No one will forgot the match between Afg vs SA, where match tied and agian super over also tied - match lost at the last ball of the supetlr over - it was the brilliant match and no one will forget this nail biting match. Other teams also performed well but lost in some key moments and every one thought that there will be many suprises but due to experience top teams stayed in the movement and won the matches
Especially Zimbambe's comeback and they are undefeated in this tournament so far whihc was great for the sports

## Player Performances:
There were some great performances from individuals but some ended up in losing cause, but surely they will learn from them and improve in future
 These stats are after 33 matches and wrote this blog befote 34th matche
 
Great innings by Yuvraj Samra, Nissanka, Tucker - no one will forgot the Gurbaz innings against SA in super over match

Highest wickets by Shadley van Schalkwyk from USA and Michael Leask from Scotland

this shows that how much teams are prepared for this worldcup and Highest runs till now from Seilfert and Deependra singh Airee

## Crowd:
Crowd support was excellent for this world cup, never seen this much support from crowd in India and Srilanka turned out and supporting each teams
Especially Nepal supporters felt match was happening in Nepal - This shows audiences interest in this cricket and close matches will help to grow sports aroind the worldcup

## The Pitch:
when it comes to everyone talk about 22yards the pitch which plays pivotal role in cricket as everyone thought that it will be road and plenty of runs will be scored, but it was a proper contest between bat and ball

but till now most of the matches are won by batting first, this might due to lack of due whcih generally helps the chasing team - it was a good contest to watch out for


## My Opinion

I think this perfomances will boost player, and teams for better preparation for next world cup, i think associated nations won the hearts of everyone with their amazing perfomances and fighting spirit

Im quite sure that they will improve and better prepated for next global event in cricket and show their mark and upset the top teams.
